Interview Practice Questions from Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree

1.<i><b> What is the most influential book or blog post you’ve read regarding web development?</b></i><br>
  I have not read a book or a blog post regarding web development. But what influenced me to learn this field was a video that I saw on Udacity's website. It was a student success story of a student that ended up working at Google.
  I got interested in programming in general since I was little. I used to play games and wonder how they were made. Then websites came along as I grew up and again I was wondering how they were made. The time came to choose my profession and I chose programming. Web development and specifically full stack is what I chose to learn because I wanted to be able to build something and to build it from scratch. Throughout the course we've built several projects and I enjoyed the process as well ass seeing the end result.

2. <i><b>Tell me about a web application you have built. Why did you choose to build it? What did you learn? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?</b></i><br>

3. <i><b>Write a function in Python that takes a list of strings and returns a single string that is an HTML unordered list (< ul > ... < /ul >) of those strings. You should include a brief explanation of your code. Then, what would you have to consider if the original list was provided by user input?</b></i>
  
4. <i><b>List 2-3 attacks that web applications are vulnerable to. How do these attacks work? How can we prevent those attacks? </b></i><br>

5. <i><b>Expand on the starter code and include a route that simulates rolling two dice and returns the result in JSON. You should include a brief explanation of your code.</b></i>

6. <i><b>If you were to start your full-stack developer position today, what would be your goals a year from now?</b></i><br>
